# Hangman Game

The purpose of designing this hangman game was to practice the skills learned in several of the P5 and Javascript tutorials that I have been working on. 

The basis for the game came from a book I've been working through [JavaScript for Kids](https://nostarch.com/javascriptforkids).   I significantly reworked the code to create a game that ran on the web instead of through the console.   I had to go back and relearn a few of the HTML elements from last sememster to get it to work.  

I used the skills I've been learning from the [Getting Started with p5.js](https://p5js.org/books/) to add the Hangman animation.   I have learned more about p5 than I used in this tutorial but for this mini-project I was mostly focusing on integrating what I'd had learned into a working product.
